                <p>The abandoned son of Frost Giant royalty, Loki Laufeyson was rescued from his home realm of Jotunheim and raised as a prince of Asgard by King Odin. Soon Loki became the God of Mischief and became a potent agent of evil and chaos across the realms.
        The abandoned son of Frost Giant royalty, Loki Laufeyson was rescued from his home realm of Jotunheim and raised as a prince of Asgard by King Odin. Soon Loki became the God of Mischief and became a potent agent of evil and chaos across the realms</p>
                <p>The ever-scheming Loki, raised as the son of King Odin and Queen Frigga of Asgard, is resentful of living in his brother Thor’s shadow. Loki studied magical arts earning the “God of Mischief” title, while his brother pursued physical prowess. 
                    Believing himself to be the rightful King of Asgard, Loki schemes to undermine the God of Thunder’s ascension to the throne, desperate for his father’s approval and to be seen as an equal to Thor</p>
                <p>During Thor’s banishment to the realm Midgard, Odin revealed Loki’s true parentage. Ages ago, Odin fought and defeated Laufey and the Frost Giants of Jotunheim in a great war. Abandoned and left for dead as a baby due to his diminutive size, 
                    Odin took Loki, son of Laufey, to Asgard to raise him as his son and a prince in order to one day unite the Frost Giants and the Asgards in peace.</p>
